**Introduction :**

I have made this project on Loan Calculator System. This Project is helpful in calculating the loan amount with their total interest to be paid and with the variable rate of interests and various banks giving each and every details about loan with tenure period (duration). 


**Problem Statement :**

Normally people uses various website to find the perfect calculator of their need and ultimately getting none of them. While some the websites asks the personal information while some websites need to login to their website first and proceed to calculator which who knows
they will get the calculator they need or any other.


**Solution :
**
The feature of this simple java application is basically the calculating the loan details of the user who inputs their data. This is very much user-friendly that user just need to enter the data and click on the one button ‘Calculate’ Button and the details will be provided to user within the fraction of seconds. The simple java application uses the swing components which are light-weight, rich-controls and highly customizable. Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI Applications.

**Conclusion :**

This project “Loan Calculator System” uses the Swing Components of JApplet in Advanced Java Programming language. Applets are dynamic and interactive programs. Applets are usually small in size and facilitate event-driven applications that can be transported over the web. This Project fulfils the need of the user which basically every user need like hassle free calculations.

* ***NOTE :** The names of the bank used in this application are only just for educational purpose and for making it easier for learners to understand the project. Also all the interest rate values are imaginary, it might vary in real.*

Happy Coding! :)
